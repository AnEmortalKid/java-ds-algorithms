# Java Data Structures and Algorithms
Trying out various DS and Algorithms for learning purposes and to refresh my Java.

## Strings
- [String has unique characters](/src/main/java/anthonynsimon/dsalgorithms/strings/UniqueCharacters.java)
- [Check if string is permutation of another](/src/main/java/anthonynsimon/dsalgorithms/strings/PermutationMatch.java)
- [URLify string](/src/main/java/anthonynsimon/dsalgorithms/strings/Urlifier.java)
